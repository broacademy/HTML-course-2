# Homework

1. I suggest starting to learn grids with any of the following games:

- [Grid Attack](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack) is expertly designed and will provide you with a fun and interactive way to learn about CSS Grid. The objective is to use CSS Grid to alter the landscape to defeat demons. With 80 levels to play through, you'll have plenty of opportunities to practice and master this important web development skill.     
- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) teaches players about the CSS grid layout system by challenging them to grow a garden by writing CSS code. Players must use grid properties to arrange plants in a grid, working through various levels.     
- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) An interactive game for learning CSS Grid. Grid Garden provides interactive tasks to teach you how to apply CSS Grid.      
- [Grid Critters](https://gridcritters.com/) is another interactive challenge-based platform to learn the different parts of the Grid Layout spec in a video-game-like environment. The course includes 10 chapters, each broken down into various levels, some as many as 20-26 levels. Very cool, but expensive.    

This will allow you to quickly get into the technology.     

2. You need to add theory:        
[Interactive grid course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-grid-by-building-a-magazine/step-1) 

Optional: Practice creating grids. Start with simple small examples. Rewrite the same examples you did with flex into grids. Take the [page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-product-landing-page-project/build-a-product-landing-page) as the final example.    

4. Add grids to your work where they are more convenient than flex layouts.
    For example: 
    - about us 
    - how to binabox work
    - partners
    - catalog layout
    - definition list in catalog item page
