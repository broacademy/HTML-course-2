### Introduction to Forms

I highly recommend reading it because this series of articles can give you a good understanding of forms, and you might not need to read anything else :)

[Web forms. Working with user data.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials of web forms. Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface. However, for historical and technical reasons, it's not always obvious how to use them to their full potential. In the articles listed below, we'll cover all the essential aspects of Web forms including marking up their HTML structure, styling form controls, validating form data, and submitting data to the server.

ðŸŸ¢ [Your first form.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form) This article provides your very first experience of creating a web form, including designing a simple form, implementing it using the right HTML form controls and other HTML elements, adding some very simple styling via CSS, and describing how data is sent to a server. 

ðŸŸ¢ [How to structure a web form.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) With the basics out of the way, we'll now look in more detail at the elements used to provide structure and meaning to the different parts of a form.

ðŸŸ¢ [Basic native form controls.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls) We will look at the functionality of the different form controls, or widgets, in detail â€” studying all the different options available to collect different types of data. In this particular article, we will look at the original set of form controls, available in all browsers since the early days of the web.

ðŸŸ¢ [The HTML5 input types.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types) We'll look at the functionality of newer form controls in detail, including some new input types, which were added in HTML5 to allow the collection of specific types of data. 

ðŸŸ¢ [Other form controls.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Other_form_controls) We now look at the functionality of non-<input> form elements in detail, from other control types such as drop-down lists and multi-line text fields, to other useful form features such as the <output> element (which we saw in action in the previous article), and progress bars.

ðŸŸ¢ [Advanced form styling.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Advanced_form_styling) In this article, we will see what can be done with CSS to style the types of form controls that are more difficult to style â€” the "bad" and "ugly" categories. 

ðŸŸ¢ [Styling web forms.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Styling_web_forms) We'll show how to style forms in CSS.

ðŸŸ¢ [UI pseudo-classes.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/UI_pseudo-classes) In this article, we explore the different UI pseudo-classes available for styling forms in different states.

ðŸŸ¢ [Client-side form validation.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.

[Sending form data.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data) Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form. This article looks at what happens when a user submits a form â€” where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.

[How to build custom form controls.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_build_custom_form_controls) In this article, we will discuss how to build a custom control. To that end, we will work with an example: rebuilding the `<select>` element. We will also discuss how, when, and whether building your own control makes sense, and what to consider when building a control is a requirement.
