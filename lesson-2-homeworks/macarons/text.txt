For macarons:

100 g
Almond flour
110 g

Cream 38%
50 ml
Fine granulated sugar
50 g

Preparation method

Step 1

How to get almond flour:  
You can prepare almond flour as follows:
In a store where they sell nuts, you can ask them to grind the nuts into flour (they do this in a coffee grinder).
Sift it
The almonds should be peeled if you are making white macarons. 
If making chocolate macarons, you can use regular almonds. 

How to make flour for macarons:
Preheat the oven to 150 degrees. 
Mix almond flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa in a food processor for 2 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, pour the dry mixture onto the sheet, and dry it in the oven for 5 minutes. 
Sift through a very fine sieve.

Step 2

Whisk the egg whites, gradually adding granulated sugar until shiny. Add the dry mixture to the egg whites and gently mix from top to bottom. 
The egg mixture will have a viscous consistency.

Step 3

Prepare the ganache. 
Heat the cream, add the broken pieces of chocolate.  
Let it cool and refrigerate (preferably overnight). 
Stir until fully dissolved.

Step 4

Place the mixture into a pastry bag with a round nozzle and pipe small, evenly sized circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Leave the baking sheet for 1 hour (I had a crust form in 30 minutes) at room temperature to form a crust.
"This is very important; if the crust does not form, cracks will appear on the surface of the macarons during baking. You can check by touching the surface with your finger; if it doesn't stick, you can bake it."
Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, turning the baking sheet 180° after 6 minutes to ensure even baking.

Step 5
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and remove the parchment paper with the cookies. 
Sprinkle cold water on the cookies, then return the parchment with the cookies back to the baking sheet.

Step 6

Assembly. Squeeze the filling from the pastry bag onto one half of the macaron and cover with the other half.

HOUSEKEEPING TIP
“Macaron (French: Macaron) is a French confection made from egg whites, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, ground almonds, and food coloring. It is usually made in the shape of cookies; cream or jam is placed between two layers. The finished product is soft, with a smooth surface, and melts in the mouth. Macarons are sold in French McDonald’s; since 2010, these cookies have been known in the USA and Canada; their version is known in Japan.”
