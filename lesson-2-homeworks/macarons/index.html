<h2> Preparation method </h2> 

<h3>Step 1</h3> 
 
<p id="almont-flour">How to get almond flour:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a store where they sell nuts, you can ask them to grind the nuts into flour (they do this in a coffee grinder).</li>
<li>Sift it</li>
<li>The almonds should be peeled if you are making white macarons.</li>
<li>If making chocolate macarons, you can use regular almonds.</li>
</ol>

<p>How to make flour for macarons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees.</li>
<li>Mix almond flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa in a food processor for 2 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, pour the dry mixture onto the sheet, and dry it in the oven for 5 minutes.
Sift through a very fine sieve.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
 
<ul>
    <li>Whisk the egg whites, gradually adding granulated sugar until shiny. Add the dry mixture to the egg whites and gently mix from top to bottom. </li>
        <li>The egg mixture will have a viscous consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
 <p>Prepare the ganache.</p>

 <ol>
    <li>Heat the cream, add the pieces of chocolate.</li>
        <li>Let it cool and refrigerate (preferably overnight).</li>
            <li>Stir until fully dissolved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Place the mixture into a pastry bag with a round nozzle and pipe small, evenly sized circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Leave the baking sheet for 1 hour (I had a crust form in 30 minutes) at room temperature to form a crust.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
"This is very important; if the crust does not form, cracks will appear on the surface of the macarons during baking. You can check by touching the surface with your finger; if it doesn't stick, you can bake it."</blockquote>
<p>Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, turning the baking sheet 180° after 6 minutes to ensure even baking.</p>

<h3>Step 5 </h3>
    <ul>
<li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and remove the parchment paper with the cookies.</li>
<li>Sprinkle cold water on the cookies, then return the parchment with the cookies back to the baking sheet.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Assembly. Squeeze the filling from the pastry bag onto one half of the macaron and cover with the other half.</p>

<h2>HOUSEKEEPING TIP</h2>
<blockquote><a href="">«Macaron (French: Macaron)</a>— is a French confection made from egg whites, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, ground almonds, and food coloring. It is usually made in the shape of cookies; cream or jam is placed between two layers. The finished product is soft, with a smooth surface, and melts in the mouth. Macarons are sold in French McDonald’s; since 2010, these cookies have been known in the USA and Canada; their version is known in Japan.»</blockquote>
